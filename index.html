            <h1>Welcome to Beetlebites</h1>
            <p>Beetlebites is more than a restaurant; it's a culinary cabinet of curiosities. Tucked away in a
                vine-covered
                building, this eatery invites you into a world where gothic charm meets inventive gastronomy.</p>
            <p>
                The menu is a celebration of the unexpected. Our chefs craft bold, seasonally-inspired dishes that
                transform
                simple, locally-sourced ingredients into edible art. From our signature "Moth Wings" - a surprising take
                on
                crispy poultry - to the rich, earthy flavors of our foraged mushroom risotto, every plate is an
                adventure.
